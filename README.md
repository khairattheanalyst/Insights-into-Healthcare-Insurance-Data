**INTRODUCTION**

With rising healthcare expenses and the growing need for personalized insurance packages, it is critical for insurance companies and healthcare providers to understand the risk profiles of their customers. This analysis provides data-driven insights that can guide premium pricing, improve healthcare services, and promote healthier lifestyles among insured individuals.

**STAKEHOLDERS OF THE PROJECT**

The Insurance Company Executives and Healthcare Providers.

**INDUSTRY TYPE OF DATA**

This dataset falls under the Healthcare Insurance and Health Tech industry. It involves the intersection of health services, insurance policy design, risk assessment, and technology-driven data analysis to improve healthcare financing and decision-making.

**STORY OF THE DATA**

This dataset contains information on the relationship between personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits), geographic factors, and their impact on medical insurance charges. 

**WHAT DOES SUCCESS MEAN TO THE STAKEHOLDERS?**

To the Healthcare Providers, success to them means improving patient health and optimizing resource allocation by identifying at-risk individuals early and proactively managing their care. 

To the Insurance Company Executives, success to them means accurately assessing risk, improving cost efficiency and profitability, and growing their customer base by attracting and retaining low-risk patients through competitive yet sustainable pricing.

**DATA LIMITATIONS AND BIASES**

While the dataset offers valuable insights, there are several limitations to consider. First, the data was collected in 2023, which may not reflect current healthcare or insurance cost dynamics. Additionally, although regional information is included, it is generalized and may not represent the full complexity of healthcare systems in specific countries or localities. The absence of key socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation, and education which could influence the access to healthcare and insurance also limits the depth of the analysis. Lastly, gender is classified strictly as male or female, excluding non-binary identities and potentially introducing bias in the demographic insights.

**STEPS TAKEN TO CLEAN THE DATA**

1. I first adjusted the column widths to ensure that all data entries were fully visible and easy to read.

2. I applied consistent fonts and colors across the spreadsheet to improve readability and maintain a clean, professional appearance.

3. I checked for and removed duplicate records to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.

4. I checked that the 'Charges' column was in the correct currency data type, allowing for accurate calculations and formatting.

5. I used the IF formula to create a new column that categorized BMI values into groups such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese.

6. I applied borders to all data cells to help the values stand out visually and make the table easier to navigate.

7. I formatted the text in Proper Case to maintain a consistent look, especially for categorical values like region and gender.

8. I looked out for null values and blanks, and deleted any empty rows that existed between the data.

9. Overall, I enhanced the visual appearance and organization of the dataset to make it clean, structured, and analysis-ready.

**PROBLEMS BEING ADDRESSED**

Before diving into detailed insights, it is important to define the key questions this analysis is going to solve. These questions are centered around understanding how individual characteristics and lifestyle choices influence healthcare insurance costs.

1. What factors most influence insurance charges i.e Age, BMI, Smoking status?

2. How does smoking status affect insurance costs?

3. What are the insurance cost trends by region?

4. How do family size (number of dependents) and insurance cost relate?

5. How does the BMI category affect insurance charges?

6. Is there a relationship between multiple factors and high insurance costs?

7. What is the distribution of insured patients / individuals across regions, gender and age groups?

**NOTABLE TRENDS AND PATTERNS FROM THE DASHBOARD ANALYSIS**

**Key Performance Metrics**

1. The average insurance cost of smokers is higher than non-smokers with an average total of **$32,050.23**. Smokers incur 4x the insurance costs of non-smokers. 

2. The average insurance cost of non-smokers is **$8,434.27**.

3. The SouthEast region has the highest insurance cost with an average total of **$14,735.41**.

4. The SouthWest region has the least insurance cost with an average total of **$12,346.94**.

5. Families with 3 children have the highest insurance cost with an average total of **$15,355.32**.

6. Families with 5 children have the least insurance cost with an average total of **$8,786.04**. 

7. Individuals in the obese category have the highest insurance cost with an average total of **$15,510.92**.

8. Individuals in the underweight category have the lowest insurance charge with an average total of **$8,852.20**.

9. The age group 60-66 have the highest insurance cost with an average total of **$21,248.02**. 

10. The age group 18-24 have the lowest insurance cost with an average total of **$9,037.95**.

11. Smokers that are obese have the highest insurance cost with an average total of **$41,355.87**.

12. Non-Smokers that are underweight have the least insurance cost with an average total of **$5,532.99**.

13. The SouthEast has the most number of persons insured.

14. The NorthEast and North West have the least number of persons insured.

**DATA-DRIVEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GROWTH**

1. **Launch Health Education Campaigns in High-Cost Regions:** SouthEast has the highest number of insured persons and the highest insurance charges. Insurance executives should monitor healthcare usage in the region and adjust premiums or services offered accordingly. Healthcare providers should organize community health drives, wellness checks, and fitness awareness programs to reduce chronic illness costs.

2. **Implement Risk-Based Premium Pricing for Smokers:** Smokers pay almost 4x more on insurance than non-smokers. Insurance executives should charge higher premiums for smokers or give discounts to those who quit and remain tobacco-free for a period. Healthcare providers should introduce or promote smoking cessation programs to reduce long-term medical costs.

3. **Tailor Insurance Packages by Family Size Trends:** Families with 3 children incur the highest charges, while those with 5 children pay the least insurance charges. Insurance executives should not assume “more kids = more cost.” Analyze usage patterns and tailor plans accordingly. Healthcare providers should target mid-sized families (2–3 kids) with preventive care plans and parenting health workshops.

4. **Use BMI and Lifestyle to Flag High-Risk Individuals Early:** Obese individuals, especially smokers, have extremely high costs, up to $41,355.87. Insurance executives can create a risk-scoring model that combines BMI and smoking status to predict high-cost customers. Healthcare providers should offer weight loss plans, fitness coaching, and meal planning support as part of wellness initiatives.

5. **Promote Inclusion in Low-Reach Regions (NorthEast & NorthWest):** These regions have the least number of insured persons, potential market not being served. Insurance executives should launch affordable micro-insurance plans or partner with local influencers/agents to build trust and reach. Healthcare providers should work with local health workers and NGOs to build awareness about the value of health insurance.

6. **Encourage and Reward Healthy Lifestyle Choices:** Non-smokers who are underweight or normal weight have the lowest costs. Insurance executives can introduce a wellness points system where healthy choices are rewarded with lower premiums or cashbacks. Healthcare providers can also add value by offering fitness assessments, diet plans, or partnerships with gyms and wellness brands.

7. **Build Gender Inclusive Healthcare Programs:** Both genders are widely represented in all regions. Insurance executives should ensure policy marketing is gender-neutral and equally accessible. Healthcare providers can customize care (i.e. maternal health for women, preventive checks for men) to increase relevance and satisfaction.

8. **Design Age-Based Preventive Plans:** Older age groups (especially 60–66) face much higher costs. Insurance executives should offer tiered insurance plans by age groups. Healthcare providers can set up regular health checkups for older adults to reduce emergency care expenses.

**CONCLUSION**

This project explored what affects the cost of healthcare insurance using information including age, gender, family size, body weight (BMI), smoking habits, and region. From the analysis, it is clear that smokers and obese individuals pay much higher insurance charges. People in the SouthEast region also tend to pay more, while those in the NorthEast and NorthWest are less likely to be insured. Families with three kids pay the highest, and older adults face higher costs too. These patterns can help insurance companies and healthcare providers make better decisions. 

Despite the value of these findings, it is important to recognize the dataset's limitations. The data, collected in 2023, may not fully capture recent trends or policy shifts in healthcare. Additionally, the lack of socioeconomic variables such as income and education levels constrains the depth of insight into access and affordability. Gender classification was also binary, which may limit the inclusivity of the analysis.

Still, by acting on the recommendations, both insurance companies and providers can grow their impact and deliver more affordable, fair, and efficient healthcare coverage.
